A learning project, to clone the tree command from Linux. Demonstrates file system mastery, terminal output, and CLI.

Impliments these options from tree:

*   listing of multiple specified directories or the current working directory
*   report of file and directory count
*   show/hide hidden files
*   list directories only
*   display the inode
*   display the device number
*   display the permitions code
*   display the owner name
*   display the owner's group
*   display the file size in bytes or kilobytes, etc.
*   display modification date and time, or date and year for older modifications
*   put \* and / after executables and directories
*   color directories and executables (as of now cannot be turned off)
*   sort the files alphebeticaly, by date modified, or not at all
*   display the files in reverse order

What should still be implimented:

*   output directly to a file
*   listing the full path to files in subdirectories
*   descending to only a specified level
*   working with status change times
*   sorting by status change time
*   listing directories first
*   input from file
*   turning off colorization
*   not printing indentation lines
*   printing time by arbitray formats
*   calculating directory sizes
*   pruning empty directories
*   pattern matching
*   JSON representation
*   \=@|> notations
*   symlink support

What I have no intention of cloning:

*   Dealing with non-printable characters
*   Quotes around names
*   Sorting by version
*   Printing with ANSI or CP437 graphics
*   XML and HTML
